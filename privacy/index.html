        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 23.08.2024 </p>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Thank you for choosing to use ThingAI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of the information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store, and use anonymous request data generated through your interactions with ThingAI. By using ThingAI, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Scope of the Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of ThingAI, regardless of how the service is accessed or used. It covers the collection, storage, and processing of anonymous request data and explains the measures we take to safeguard this data. Please note that this policy does not cover data that may be personally identifiable or collected through third-party services linked to ThingAI.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Anonymous Data Collection</h2>
        <p>When you interact with ThingAI, the service may collect certain types of data related to your requests and interactions. This data includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The content of your requests or queries made through ThingAI.</li>
            <li>Interaction timestamps (e.g., date and time of your requests).</li>
            <li>Metadata related to the technical aspects of the interaction, such as the type of device or browser used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is collected in an anonymous format, meaning it is stripped of any identifiers that could link it back to you as an individual. We do not collect, store, or process any data that can directly identify you, such as your name or email address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The anonymous request data collected is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve the quality and functionality of ThingAI by analyzing usage patterns and identifying areas for enhancement.</li>
            <li>Ensure the service operates efficiently and effectively for all users.</li>
            <li>Conduct research and analysis to better understand user needs and preferences, thereby informing future updates and features.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Storage by ThingAI</h3>
        <p>ThingAI will store the anonymous request data on a temporary basis until it is overwritten by new data. This means that only the most recent set of anonymous request data is retained by ThingAI at any given time. This approach helps us manage data storage efficiently while still providing insights needed to enhance the service.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2 Storage by the ThingAI Provider</h3>
        <p>The ThingAI provider may store anonymous request data indefinitely. This data is retained securely and used for purposes such as long-term analysis, trend identification, and ongoing research to improve the capabilities of ThingAI. Even though the data is stored indefinitely, it remains anonymous and cannot be traced back to individual users.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your anonymous request data seriously. We implement a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect and store from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encryption of data during transmission and at rest.</li>
            <li>Regular security assessments and updates to our systems.</li>
            <li>Access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we strive to protect your data, it is important to note that no security system is infallible. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of the data, and you should be aware of the potential risks when using any online service.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Sharing of Data</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer anonymous request data to outside parties. However, we may share this data with trusted third-party partners who assist us in operating ThingAI, conducting our business, or serving our users. These partners are bound by confidentiality agreements and are prohibited from using the data for any purpose other than assisting us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. User Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>Since the data we collect is anonymous, it does not fall under the same legal frameworks as personally identifiable information (PII). However, we respect your right to privacy and will strive to honor any requests related to the handling of your data, where applicable. For example, if you believe your data is not fully anonymized, you can contact us to address your concerns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will revise the effective date at the top of this policy and post the updated policy on our website. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
