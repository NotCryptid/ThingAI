<h1>The Basics</h1>
<p>If you don't want your ThingAI to have dementia then you need to setup a chat history. The chat history is basically an array containing every message sent by the user and every response generated by ThingAI which allows ThingAI to know the context of the conversation to generate acurate responses.</p>
<h1>Message JSON</h1>
<p>The message json consists of two keys, the role and content. There are 3 roles but only "user" and "assistant" is accepted by ThingAI. The "Role" key determines if the message was sent by the user or generated by ThingAI and the "content" key just contains the message.</p>
<h1>Example Message JSONs</h1>
<p>{"role": "user", "content": "Hello ThingAI!"}</p>
<p>{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello there! How may i help you today?"}</p>
<h1>Storing Message History</h1>
<p>Storing the message history is quite simple, first create an empty array and call it whatever you want. Then whenever you make a request, add the message json to the end of said array as well as the response from ThingAI.</p>
<h1>Adding Message History to the API Request</h1>
<p>The message history array should be added to the API Request json under the key "messages".</p>
