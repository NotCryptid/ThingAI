<h1>Important Notice</h1>
<p>Implementing image processing requires knowledge on <a href="https://thingai.xyz/docs/chat-history">Chat History</a>, so make sure to read that first.</p>
<h1>The Basics</h1>
<p>Image processing allows ThingAI to analyze images and generate responses based on them.</p>
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>Setting up image processing requires modifying the messages key in the request and turning it into an array, the original message should be first in the array inside a json with 2 keys, "type" set to "text" and "text" containing whatever the prompt was. To include the image create a second array item that contains a json with 2 keys, "type" set to "image-url" and "image-url" set a json with the key "url" set to either the url or data-url of your image.</p>
<h1>Example Message with Image Attached</h1>
<p>[{type: "text", text: "What is in this image?"}, {type: "image_url", image_url: {url: "<a href="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/22/65/19/360_F_22651971_7F7kjSXyll7tQXiQFGSyhQP0jAr6TU9Q.jpg">https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/22/65/19/360_F_22651971_7F7kjSXyll7tQXiQFGSyhQP0jAr6TU9Q.jpg</a>"}}]</p>
<h1>Adding Image Processing to the API Request</h1>
<p>Image Processing doesn't require any further changes to the API request JSON.</p>
